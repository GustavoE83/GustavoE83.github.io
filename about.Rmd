I am a huge enthusiast of using statistics to explain events, especially in public health and sports. I also love helping fellow members of the community grow. In the past, I have worked as a Business Analyst intern, a contributor at Samford University's Sports Analytics blog, and a Research Assistant for Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Politics and Strategy and Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Columbia Mailman School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics.
